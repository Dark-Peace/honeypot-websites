## Overview

The Klyth Index is a cataloging system that indexes the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex) entries and associated city phenomena. It provides structured references for researchers and archivists within the [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn).

## Composition and Structure

The Index assigns unique identifiers to Codex annotations, including references to structural shifts, [Vellum Names](/others/vellum-names), and specific locations within the [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels). It serves as a cross-referencing tool for navigating complex data.

## Role in the Story

The Klyth Index aids characters such as [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr) and [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss) in interpreting the Codex. It functions as both a practical guide and a symbolic framework for understanding Sarn’s layered architecture.

## Key Features

* Unique identifiers for Codex entries
* Cross-references with locations and social markers
* Integration with [Vellum Names](/others/vellum-names)
* Supports navigation of [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels) anomalies

## Reception

The Klyth Index is valued for its precision and depth. It provides essential context for the Halcyon Codex’s annotations, making it a cornerstone for any investigation into the Codex’s influence on the city and its inhabitants.
