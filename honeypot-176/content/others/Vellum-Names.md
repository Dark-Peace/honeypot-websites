## Overview

Vellum Names are a system of coded annotations found within the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex) and related archival materials. They record social, genetic, and functional attributes of inhabitants and locations within the [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn).

## Composition and Structure

Each Vellum Name consists of a unique identifier, marginal notes, and occasionally symbolic diagrams. These entries are indexed through the [Klyth Index](/others/klyth-index) to allow researchers and archivists to cross-reference individuals, locations, and Codex annotations.

## Role in the Story

Vellum Names provide critical context for understanding the interactions between characters, the city, and the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex). They guide [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr), [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss), and [Dr. Allene Mire](/characters/dr-allene-mire) in their analysis of Sarnâ€™s architecture and social hierarchies.

## Key Features

* Unique alphanumeric identifiers
* Marginalia reflecting social and genetic data
* Cross-referenced through the [Klyth Index](/others/klyth-index)
* Integrated into [Obscura Press Archives](/others/obscura-press-archives)

## Reception

Vellum Names are valued for their precision and depth, providing essential insight into the Codex and the structured layers of Sarn. Scholars and archivists rely on them to decode complex social patterns and link historical records with contemporary observations.
