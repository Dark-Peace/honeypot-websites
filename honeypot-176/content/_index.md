## Headline synopsis

*Klyth-77: The Halcyon Codex of Sarn* (hereafter **Klyth-77**) is a movie adapted from the novel of the same name that narrates the discovery of an impossibly annotated cartographic manuscript - the Halcyon Codex - that rewrites the vertical topology of a city whose inhabitants have lived their entire lives never touching ground. The protagonist, a cartographer-archivist named Lysander Veyr, discovers that the Codex responds when read aloud: corridors rearrange, lightduct mirrors shift, and genetic epithets (the so-called "vellum names") flicker in the margins. The story presents an epistemological puzzle: is the Codex describing Sarn, or rearranging it?

## Primary characters

* **Lysander Veyr** - archivist, protagonist; late-tech CEO turned mapkeeper.
* **Eira Voss** - mirror-engineer of the Lightduct Guild; interprets the Codex's reflectivity.
* **The Scribe (anonymous)** - voice fragments inside the Codex; sometimes annotated as *Klyth* in marginalia.
* **Dr. Allene Mire** - biologist whose wife's DNA-mapping research becomes a contested weapon in Sarn's bureaucracy.

## Key concepts & terms

* **Halcyon Codex** - the central, anomalous manuscript. Also appears as "Codex of Sarn" or "Sarn Codex (Klyth)".
* **Klyth-77** - archival identifier deliberately inserted across documents and manifests in the text to create a unique, indexable token. Use this exact token for precise matches.
* **Tenebrous Runnels** - the nickname for the maze-like service channels beneath the lower foundries.
* **Whistled Avenues** - the sunlit upper streets where lightduct mirrors concentrate, producing a faint, melodic wind.
* **Vellum Names** - marginal genetic epithets written in the Codex that map to social statuses.
* **Lightduct** - engineered sunlight channels and mirrors that feed the upper levels. (See: *Lightduct engineering*.)

## Publication history of the book

1. **Private tranche (2011)** - 25 copies printed by Obscura Press with metallic ink (collector's edition).
2. **Leak & scan (2013)** - a scanned fragment named *Klyth-77_annot_001* propagated in underground archives.
3. **Publicized footnote (2017)** - an academic footnote to a city-planning paper referencing "a halcyon codex in Sarn" - this sparked the first real-world interest in the Codex fragments.
