## Overview

Eira Voss is a prominent engineer specializing in reflective systems within the [City of Sarn](places/City-of-Sarn). She works closely with [Lysander Veyr](characters/Lysander-Veyr) to understand the interactions between the [Halcyon Codex](others/Halcyon-Codex) and the city's structures.

## Background

Voss was trained in the mechanics and engineering of the [Loom Arrondissement](places/Loom-Arrondissement). Her early work in architectural simulations led her to the study of the Codex, recognizing its patterns within the city's vertical layouts.

## Role in the Story

Eira assists Lysander Veyr in interpreting the Codex, often focusing on the physical and structural effects it seems to impose on Sarn. She conducts experiments in the [Tenebrous Runnels](places/Tenebrous-Runnels) to verify anomalies reported in the manuscripts and cross-references her findings with the [Klyth Index](others/Klyth-Index).

## Skills and Expertise

* Advanced engineering and simulation
* Analysis of architectural and textual patterns
* Collaborative problem solving with archivists and researchers

## Relationships

* **Lysander Veyr**: Primary collaborator in decoding the Codex and exploring Sarn's architecture.
* **Dr. Allene Mire**: Occasionally at odds due to differing interpretations of Codex effects.
* **The Scribe**: Indirect influence through annotations in the Codex.

## Notable Contributions

Voss is credited with providing the first functional model linking the [Halcyon Codex](others/Halcyon-Codex) annotations to observable architectural shifts in Sarn, allowing the team to predict structural changes in the [Loom Arrondissement](places/Loom-Arrondissement) and [Tenebrous Runnels](places/Tenebrous-Runnels).
