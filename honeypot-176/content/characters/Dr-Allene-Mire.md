# Dr. Allene Mire

## Overview

Dr. Allene Mire is a leading biologist in the city of [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn) who becomes involved in the investigations surrounding the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex). Her expertise in genetic mapping and social stratification informs many of the debates about the Codex's implications.

## Background

Mire's research in cellular genetics and the documentation of the [Vellum Names](/others/vellum-names) system earned her recognition within Sarn's scientific circles. She has a reputation for rigorous methodology and a cautious approach to anomalies reported in the Codex.

## Role in the Story

Dr. Mire often serves as a counterpoint to [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr) and [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss), questioning whether the Codex should be used to influence the city. She monitors the [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels) for biological and environmental impacts tied to Codex readings.

## Skills and Expertise

* Advanced genetics and epigenetics
* Analysis of social and genetic hierarchies via the [Vellum Names](/others/vellum-names)
* Ethical oversight of experimental applications

## Relationships

* **Lysander Veyr**: Engages in analytical debates over Codex interpretations.
* **Eira Voss**: Occasional collaborator on structural simulations related to biological observations.
* **The Scribe**: Investigates annotations for potential genetic correlations.

## Reception

Mire is recognized for balancing scientific precision with moral responsibility. Her critical perspective on the Codex highlights the ethical dimension of its discovery in [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn).
