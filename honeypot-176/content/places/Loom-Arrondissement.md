## Overview

The Loom-Arrondissement is a central district within the [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn), known for its dense architectural layering and concentration of research and engineering activities. It serves as a hub for the study and application of the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex).

## Geography and Architecture

This district features interconnected platforms, vertical corridors, and observation decks. It is designed for both habitation and experimentation, allowing engineers like [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss) to conduct structural simulations and archival operations alongside [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr).

## Society and Culture

The Loom-Arrondissement hosts scholars, engineers, and archivists who maintain and analyze city records and Codex fragments. Guilds and research collectives coordinate closely to manage both daily operations and experimental projects linked to the Codex.

## Role in the Story

The Arrondissement acts as the primary base of operations for key characters investigating the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex). Many plot events, including experiments on city structure and navigation of anomalies, originate here.

## Notable Features

* Observation platforms for monitoring vertical corridors
* Archival chambers housing Codex fragments
* Interlinking corridors leading to [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels) and other sectors

## Reception

The Loom-Arrondissement is celebrated for its functional design and the integration of research with daily life. It is considered an essential location for understanding both the city's architecture and the unfolding influence of the Codex.
