## Overview

The Tenebrous Runnels are a labyrinthine network of subterranean tunnels beneath the [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn). They connect the [Lower Foundries](/places/lower-foundries) to upper districts and provide secretive passageways utilized by key characters, including [Orrin Kael](/characters/orrin-kael).

## Geography and Architecture

These tunnels are narrow, winding, and partially unstable, with interlocking chambers and maintenance corridors. Their complexity is both practical and symbolic, serving as hidden arteries through the city that mirror the coded information in the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex).

## Society and Culture

The Runnels are frequented by explorers, archivists, and operatives. Knowledge of their paths is often restricted to those involved in research or covert operations, making them a critical environment for characters such as [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr) and [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss).

## Role in the Story

The Tenebrous Runnels are central to the investigation of the Codex, serving as both a testing ground for structural predictions and a means of accessing hidden sectors of the city. Events in these passages often reveal new Codex anomalies or shifts in Sarn’s architecture.

## Notable Features

* Interconnected tunnels spanning multiple layers of Sarn
* Restricted access chambers for experimentation
* Observation points for monitoring city-wide structural changes

## Reception

The Runnels are noted for their enigmatic design and critical narrative function. They embody the interplay between hidden knowledge and practical navigation within the city, reflecting the Codex’s influence.
