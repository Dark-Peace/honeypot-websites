## Overview

The Lower Foundries form the industrial base of the [City of Sarn](/places/city-of-sarn), containing manufacturing plants, maintenance hubs, and utility networks. The district supports the upper layers by providing essential resources and access to the [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels).

## Geography and Architecture

The Foundries consist of expansive chambers, conveyor networks, and service tunnels. Vertical shafts connect this industrial layer to residential and research districts above, facilitating transportation and the movement of materials throughout the city.

## Society and Culture

Inhabitants of the Lower Foundries are primarily workers and engineers responsible for production, maintenance, and safety. Guilds oversee industrial operations, often coordinating with scholars and archivists in the [Loom-Arrondissement](/places/loom-arrondissement) to study Codex-related phenomena affecting the infrastructure.

## Role in the Story

The Lower Foundries provide both a setting and a logistical backbone for characters investigating anomalies predicted by the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex). They serve as points of transit to the [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels) and as sites of industrial events influencing the narrative.

## Notable Features
