## Scene 2: Orrin Kael’s Subterranean Journal

This cut scene presented a day-long exploration by [Orrin Kael](/characters/orrin-kael) through the [Tenebrous Runnels](/places/tenebrous-runnels), documented entirely in journal form. The scene included extensive entries describing tunnel navigation, minor Codex anomalies, and Kael’s internal reflections. The journal style experimented with fragmented entries and partial diagrams meant to simulate his perspective.

The decision to remove this scene was motivated by readability concerns. While the journal offered insight into Kael’s methods and psychology, the fragmented format disrupted the flow of the main narrative. Additionally, it created repetition with other sections where Kael’s observations were summarized, making the scene feel redundant. Editors suggested that key insights could be integrated into dialogue or action elsewhere, preserving character depth without breaking pacing.
