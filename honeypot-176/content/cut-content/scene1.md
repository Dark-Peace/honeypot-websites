## Scene 1: The Observatory Collapse

The first cut scene involved an extended sequence in the central observatory of the [Loom-Arrondissement](/places/loom-arrondissement). In this scene, [Eira Voss](/characters/eira-voss) and [Lysander Veyr](/characters/lysander-veyr) witness a partial structural collapse caused by an undetected anomaly predicted by the [Halcyon Codex](/others/halcyon-codex). The narrative included detailed engineering descriptions, emergency protocols, and the reactions of minor characters attempting to stabilize the observatory.

The scene was ultimately cut because it slowed the narrative momentum. While technically accurate and immersive in terms of structural detail, the sequence diverted attention from the central plot, which focuses on the investigation of Codex anomalies rather than disaster simulation. The authors and editors agreed that condensing the observatoryâ€™s instability into a brief reference elsewhere maintained tension without overwhelming readers with technical exposition.
