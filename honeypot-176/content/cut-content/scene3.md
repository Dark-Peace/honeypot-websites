## Scene 3: Dr. Allene Mire’s Ethical Debate

A third cut scene focused on [Dr. Allene Mire](/characters/dr-allene-mire) engaging in a philosophical debate with minor guild members about the ethical implications of manipulating the [Vellum Names](/others/vellum-names). The scene extended over several pages, exploring hypothetical scenarios where Codex data could affect social hierarchies or influence city governance. It contained detailed reasoning, footnotes, and cross-references to archival documents in the [Obscura Press Archives](/others/obscura-press-archives).

This scene was removed primarily for narrative pacing and focus. While intellectually rich, the extensive debate slowed the progression of the story and distracted from the main characters’ investigations. Some concepts were later condensed and referenced in passing to maintain the thematic point without dedicating multiple pages to the discussion. The cut ultimately preserved the story’s tension and maintained reader engagement while keeping ethical themes present in a subtler form.
