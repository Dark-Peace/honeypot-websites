## Scene 3: Relay Choir Ritual

The third cut scene involved the [Relay Choir](/characters/relay-choir) performing a ritualized sequence in the Subsignal Corridors, intended to illustrate the harmonic properties of the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity). Choir members were shown moving through narrow corridors, chanting coordinated sequences, and interacting with glowing conduits to synchronize signal pulses. The visual effect was ethereal, highlighting the emergent intelligence of the relay system in a highly symbolic manner.

Despite its artistic ambition, the scene was removed for clarity and timing reasons. The sequence, though visually and sonically impressive, required significant exposition to be meaningful, which would have interrupted the tension built in the preceding exploration sequences. The filmmakers instead conveyed the Choir’s influence through brief audio cues and partial appearances, suggesting the Semaphore’s presence without slowing the narrative with an extended ritual.

From a technical standpoint, the scene involved complex choreography and special effects that were challenging to integrate into the final edit. Lighting, reflective panels, and interactive signal pulses required extensive post-production work, and the team prioritized other sequences to stay within the budget and schedule constraints. As a result, only fragments of this ritual remain visible in subtle cues and sound design throughout the final film.
