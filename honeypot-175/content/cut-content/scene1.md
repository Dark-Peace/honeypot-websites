## Scene 1: The Orbital Greenhouse

The first cut scene depicted a massive orbital greenhouse attached to the lower decks of [Orbital Relay Keta-9](/places/orbital-relay-keta-9). It was meant to provide a visual counterpoint to the sterile metallic corridors, showing that life persisted in carefully controlled environments within the orbital network. The scene included sweeping camera shots through glass domes filled with plants, bioluminescent fungi, and suspended irrigation channels, emphasizing the contrast between organic growth and artificial structures.

This scene was removed primarily due to pacing concerns. The film’s tension relies on claustrophobic, decaying interiors and slow revelation of the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity). The greenhouse sequence, while visually stunning, slowed down the narrative flow and distracted from the main plot. Additionally, the CGI required to make the greenhouse appear fully integrated into the relay proved prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, leading to its excision from the final cut.

A secondary reason was thematic. Director [Halver](/characters/director-halver) felt that the inclusion of vibrant life undermined the oppressive atmosphere that underscores the characters’ struggle with decaying technology and emergent signal intelligence. While the greenhouse concept remains in some pre-production storyboards, the final film maintains a sterile, industrial aesthetic that aligns with the central motifs of memory and entropy.
