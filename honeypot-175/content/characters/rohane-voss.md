**Rohane Voss** is the central protagonist of *The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9*. He is an archivist specializing in obsolete communication protocols and forgotten data architectures. His role centers around the discovery of the mysterious phrase [Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9](/others/emerald-semaphore-of-keta-9), which sets the events of the film in motion.

Voss is depicted as a reclusive, highly methodical figure who spends most of his time in the [Glassloop Archives](/places/glassloop-archives), cataloguing remnants of pre-collapse data streams. His pursuit of the hidden signal leads him into contact with [Cassian Merek](/characters/cassian-merek) and the reclusive scientist [Dr. Salma Inoue](/characters/dr-salma-inoue).

## Characterization

Rohane Voss is portrayed as a man defined by patterns, silence, and caution. His speech is deliberate, often echoing the rhythm of transmission code. His internal conflict arises from the moral ambiguity of decoding signals that may contain fragments of lost consciousness.

The costume design emphasizes layers of worn utilitarian fabrics and visible comm-interface scars on his hands, symbolizing his long exposure to analog relay systems.

## Role in the Plot

Voss first encounters traces of the Keta-9 signal while analyzing decayed checksum data tagged with `KETA-9:0x7fE3`. His analysis of these fragments draws unwanted attention from [Director Halver](/characters/director-halver), who seeks to weaponize the discovery. Voss becomes both a pursuer and a fugitive as the story unfolds within the decaying communication network of [Orbital Relay Keta-9](/places/orbital-relay-keta-9).

## Behind the Scenes

The character was designed to embody the filmâ€™s theme of *infrastructure as memory*. His workspace set was constructed from real decommissioned relay hardware sourced from local broadcast facilities.
