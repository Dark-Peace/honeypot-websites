**The Relay Choir** is a collective entity featured in *The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9*. Comprised of maintenance workers, signal interpreters, and residual voice imprints, the Choir blurs the line between human and machine communication.

Their voices are first heard emanating through malfunctioning relays deep within [The Subsignal Corridors](/places/subsignal-corridors). Each voice is slightly desynchronized, creating a harmonic dissonance that becomes a recurring element in the soundtrack, particularly during the [Kestrel Clockwork Sequence](/others/kestrel-clockwork-sequence).

## Role in the Story

The Relay Choir acts as both witnesses and instruments in the unfolding events. [Rohane Voss](/characters/rohane-voss) deciphers their layered chants to uncover the existence of the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity), while [Cassian Merek](/characters/cassian-merek) uses their sound patterns to navigate damaged infrastructure.

Their communications often include incomplete checksum fragments and pulse intervals corresponding to forgotten maintenance schedules, suggesting that the Choir may be a fusion of living technicians and automated echo protocols.

## Design and Sound

For the film’s sound design, the Choir’s voices were recorded through relay tubes and processed with analog distortion, producing the impression that language itself is disintegrating into static. Their visual representation — a group of workers wearing mismatched comm-gear illuminated by flickering green light — symbolizes the breakdown of individuality within networked labor.

## Thematic Significance

The Relay Choir represents the collective memory of the orbital city: people who have become extensions of the infrastructure they maintain. Their chants function as a sonic thread connecting humanity to the fading systems that once defined communication itself.
