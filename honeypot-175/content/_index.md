# The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9

**The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9** is a 2024 science-fantasy / neo-noir feature film written and directed by **Mira Halvorsen** and produced by Glassloop Atelier. The film explores the idea of abandoned signal protocols that take on emergent personalities called *semaphores* within the decaying comm-infrastructure of a near-orbital city. The movie is notable inside its world for the repeated sequence phrase **"Kestrel Clockwork Sequence Keta-9"**, and for the titular evocative line **"Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9"** which appears as a coded refrain in the soundtrack.

## Synopsis

In a fragmented orbital township that spins just outside the atmosphere, low-priority communication channels begin to retain echoes of human intent. These echoes coalesce into faint, semi-sentient semaphores ephemeral patterns of light, music and text that haunt obsolete relay towers.

When **Rohane Voss**, a jaded archivist of obsolete protocols, discovers a hidden semaphore that repeats the phrase *"Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9"*, he believes it may contain a woman’s lost message: a transcript of an experiment that once attempted to map memory into signal. Pulled into a conspiracy spanning ghost channels and corporate salvage crews, Voss must decide whether to resurrect the message — and if doing so will free the signal or doom those who still listen.

## Cast

* **Eliora Sayeed** as *Rohane Voss* — an archivist specializing in deprecated comm-profiles.
* **Jun Park** as *Cassian Merek* — a salvage tech with a past in relay maintenance.
* **Ana-Mirelle Ortis** as *Dr. Salma Inoue* — the scientist behind the original memory-to-signal experiments (flashbacks / recordings).
* **Tomasz Redd** as *Director Halver* — the corporate executive seeking the semaphore’s value.
* **Ensemble**: Local choir & relay chorus (credited as "The Keta-9 Chorus").

## Production

* **Director / Writer:** Mira Halvorsen
* **Cinematography:** Oren Díaz (practical lighting, many long takes inside narrow relay corridors)
* **Art Direction:** layered practical sets augmented with hand-made fiber-optic props to simulate "semaphore textures."
* **Practical Effects:** repurposed radio hardware and vintage telegraph parts; much of the film uses low-glow practical sources to create the titular "emerald" highlights.
* **Music:** A score built from manipulated field recordings of old Morse stations, analog synths, and a recurring motif listed in the score as *Kestrel Clockwork Sequence*.

Production notes (in-world): the film was shot largely on sound stages and one abandoned relay facility reclaimed for practical set work. Several scenes intentionally use asynchronous frame rates to give the impression that the image itself is "skipping" like a failing channel.



## Release

* **Premiere:** Autumn Circuit Film Collective, "Signal Strand" program, 2024.
* **Distribution:** Limited festival and midnight screenings.
* **Runtime:** 107 minutes.
* **Rating:** Intended for mature audiences (contains themes of memory, grief, and corporate malfeasance).



## Themes & Analysis

* **Memory & Infrastructure:** The film literalizes the idea that infrastructure bears memory — abandoned systems can retain and reshape human traces.
* **Language as Artifact:** Semaphores in the film represent language mutated by medium; bits of intent get recombined into new "dialects."
* **Ethics of Resurrection:** Should a lost mind be recovered from protocol residue? The film frames resurrection as both a moral and existential dilemma.
* **Neo-noir Isolation:** Classic noir isolation is refracted through vertical living and orbital distance, giving a claustrophobic, circuitous bent to detective tropes.



## Soundtrack

1. **Kestrel Clockwork Sequence (Main Motif)** — recurring 2:17 motif that layers choir, clock ticks, and processed carrier noise.
2. **Relay Chorus (Interlude)** — used during long corridor takes.
3. **Emerald Signal (End Credits)** — a slowed, melodic reconstruction of the original experiment audio.



## Trivia

* The repeated in-film refrain **"Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9"** appears as a visual title card three times and is embedded audibly in the end credits via reversed carrier noise.
* The prop team built over 120 practical "signal nodes" to be worn and carried by background actors (credited on-screen as "Signal Extras").
* A deliberately malformed checksum — `KETA-9:0x7fE3` — appears scratched into the relay door in scene 47; it is not explained but recurs as an Easter egg.
* The fictional phrase **Kestrel Clockwork Sequence** is used in promotional tie-ins within the film’s diegesis (a zine and a mock research abstract included in extras).



## Critical reception

Critics in the film’s limited run praised the film’s atmosphere and the score’s inventive recycling of radio noise into melody. Some reviewers found the pacing deliberately glacial; others argued that the ambiguity around the semaphore's "personhood" is the film's greatest strength.
