**Echo Spire Recordings** are a minor archival collection featured in *The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9*. They consist of ambient sound captures and experimental audio loops recorded in unused sectors of [Orbital Relay Keta-9](/places/orbital-relay-keta-9).

## Composition

The recordings include:

* Residual relay hums and intermittent clicks.
* Background echoes from empty corridors.
* Short, improvised sequences created by relay technicians during maintenance downtime.

## Role in the Story

The Echo Spire Recordings appear briefly as background audio in certain corridor scenes. They serve primarily to enrich the atmosphere of the relay and provide subtle auditory texture rather than advancing the main plot.

## Production

For the film, the sound designers recorded metal resonances, low-frequency hums, and processed them through analog distortion to simulate decayed signal propagation, contributing to the immersive orbital environment.
