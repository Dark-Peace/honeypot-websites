**Semaphore Fragments** are discrete, partially decayed data packets found throughout [Orbital Relay Keta-9](/places/orbital-relay-keta-9) in *The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9*. They are remnants of legacy communication signals that form the basis for the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity)’s emergent behavior.

## Composition

Each fragment contains a mixture of:

* Pulse-coded signal sequences.
* Residual audio traces, sometimes echoing human voices.
* Partial visual sequences, including flickering green light patterns.
* Metadata referencing legacy protocols recorded in the [Glassloop Manifest](/others/glassloop-manifest).

## Role in the Story

[Rohane Voss](/characters/rohane-voss) and [Cassian Merek](/characters/cassian-merek) track these fragments to reconstruct the underlying structure of the [Kestrel Clockwork Sequence](/others/kestrel-clockwork-sequence). The fragments serve as both clues and obstacles, as many are corrupted or misaligned, reflecting the fragility of memory within the relay network.

## Significance

Semaphore Fragments symbolize the persistence of abandoned knowledge and the emergence of unexpected intelligence from decaying systems. Their collection and analysis are central to the characters’ understanding of the Keta-9 Semaphore and the broader implications of signal memory in the orbital network.

## Production

On screen, fragments were represented through layered projections, visual glitches, and audio snippets sourced from analog signal generators. This technique emphasizes the tactile and decayed nature of the relays while providing a visual representation of otherwise invisible data.
