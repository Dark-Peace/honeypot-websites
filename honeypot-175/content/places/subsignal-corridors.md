**The Subsignal Corridors** are an extensive network of service tunnels within [Orbital Relay Keta-9](/places/orbital-relay-keta-9). They serve as the hidden pathways connecting the lower and upper sectors of the relay, providing access to obsolete maintenance systems.

These corridors are named for their original function of routing secondary or redundant signal lines. Over time, they became largely abandoned, retaining only faint electrical hums and sporadic pulse flashes from residual activity.

## Function

The corridors are used by [Rohane Voss](/characters/rohane-voss) and [Cassian Merek](/characters/cassian-merek) to navigate the relay unnoticed. They are also where the [Relay Choir](/characters/relay-choir) is first encountered, as their harmonic pulses resonate along the narrow passageways, amplifying signal anomalies.

The Subsignal Corridors provide critical access points for interpreting fragments of the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity) and analyzing the [Kestrel Clockwork Sequence](/others/kestrel-clockwork-sequence).

## Architecture and Environment

The corridors are narrow, metallic, and reinforced with insulated cabling along the walls. Occasional panels and junction boxes flicker with residual energy, producing intermittent green light. Air circulation is minimal, creating a dense, echoing atmosphere. Magnetic interference causes distortions in audio signals, which become a signature motif in the film’s sound design.

## Role in the Story

The Subsignal Corridors serve as the primary setting for exploration sequences and clandestine research. They symbolize the hidden infrastructure of memory and communication, emphasizing the contrast between human intention and decaying technological systems.

## Visual Design

The set design incorporated narrow scaffolding, reflective panels, and controlled fog to accentuate depth and light refraction. Cinematography utilized long, tracking shots to convey the sense of endless passageways, reinforcing the corridors’ function as both physical and symbolic conduits within the relay.
