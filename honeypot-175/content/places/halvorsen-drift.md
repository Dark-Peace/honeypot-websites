**Halvorsen’s Drift** is a decaying industrial sector on the periphery of *Orbital Relay Keta-9* and a key location in *The Emerald Semaphore of Keta-9*. The area is a cluster of broken tether rings and repurposed maintenance tunnels, named after early relay designer **Orren Halvorsen**, whose designs formed the basis for the first wave of orbital communication systems.

[ Cassian Merek ](/characters/cassian-merek) operates from a workshop hidden within the Drift, salvaging obsolete relay nodes and broadcasting equipment. The site serves as his base of operations and one of the few unmonitored zones beyond [Director Halver](/characters/director-halver)’s surveillance range.

## Environment

The Drift is characterized by near-zero gravity pockets and atmospheric instability. It is illuminated by residual green and amber flares from derelict energy conduits. The structural decay has left the area filled with drifting shards of glass and loose panels, creating a slow-moving field of debris that echoes the relay’s name.

Communication signals in the Drift are erratic, distorted by magnetic residue from failed transmission coils. This instability provides cover for independent operators like Merek, who rely on analog devices to remain undetected.

## Role in the Story

Halvorsen’s Drift functions as both a hideout and a liminal frontier between the living and automated sectors of Keta-9. It is here that Merek and [Rohane Voss](/characters/rohane-voss) establish their temporary decoding setup to analyze the [Kestrel Clockwork Sequence](/others/kestrel-clockwork-sequence).

In the third act, [Director Halver](/characters/director-halver)’s forces attempt to purge the Drift, resulting in several relay collapses and the first physical manifestation of the [Keta-9 Semaphore](/characters/keta-9-semaphore-entity).

## Design and Visuals

The production design of Halvorsen’s Drift employed rotating set pieces and floating debris rigs to simulate unstable gravity conditions. The lighting alternates between deep shadows and pulsing sodium flares, evoking the rhythm of a dying heartbeat — a motif that parallels the failing relay network itself.

## Symbolism

Halvorsen’s Drift represents the threshold between functionality and ruin, a space where discarded systems and people coexist. It embodies the film’s recurring question: whether decay is merely an end, or the environment where new forms of life begin to emerge.
